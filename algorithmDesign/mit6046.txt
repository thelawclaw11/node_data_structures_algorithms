hamiltonian cycle is np complete


interval scheduling

what is a greedy algorithm?
    is is myopic
    it tries to maximize locally
    it doesn't look forward to the future
    it is not guaranteed to find the best solution
    it is typically fast
    processes inputs one piece at a time with no apparent look-ahead


greedy interval scheduling:
    1. use simple rule to select request i
    2. reject all requests that are incompatible with i
    3. repeat until all requests are processed
